<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Vivek â€“ a passionate science communicator, tech writer, and cloud-native enthusiast.</p>

<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Climate Science, and this blog is where my love for science and technology comes together. My mission is to simplify complex ideas â€” whether itâ€™s the science of climate or the architecture of Kubernetes â€” and share them in a way thatâ€™s engaging and easy to grasp.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¬ On the science side, I dive into topics like climate change, weather patterns, and the mysteries of our universe.</p>

<p>ðŸ’» On the tech side, I write about Kubernetes, container orchestration, cloud platforms, and the tools that power modern infrastructure.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love trekking, camping, and stargazing â€” astronomy is my forever fascination.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Whether youâ€™re curious about the clouds above or the cloud in tech, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
