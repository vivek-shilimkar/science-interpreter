Hi! I'm Vivek – a passionate science communicator, tech writer, and cloud-native enthusiast.

I hold a Ph.D. in Climate Science, and this blog is where my love for science and technology comes together. My mission is to simplify complex ideas — whether it’s the science of climate or the architecture of Kubernetes — and share them in a way that’s engaging and easy to grasp.

🔬 On the science side, I dive into topics like climate change, weather patterns, and the mysteries of our universe.

💻 On the tech side, I write about Kubernetes, container orchestration, cloud platforms, and the tools that power modern infrastructure.

Outside of work, I love trekking, camping, and stargazing — astronomy is my forever fascination.

Thanks for visiting! Whether you're curious about the clouds above or the cloud in tech, I hope you find something valuable here.
